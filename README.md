# Drake External Examples

Examples of how to use [Drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) in your
own project:

* [`drake_bazel_external`](./drake_bazel_external)
* [`drake_cmake_external`](./drake_cmake_external)
* [`drake_cmake_installed`](./drake_cmake_installed)

## Continuous Integration

Scripts are provided for various CI instances in `scripts/continuous_integration`. The intended purpose of each is described below:

* `circle_ci` : exemplifies how to put a project depending on a Drake installation on Circle CI
* `jenkins` : provides complete coverage of shambhala for all subprojects and officially supported platforms
* `travis_ci` : examplifies how to put a project depending on a Drake installation on Travis CI

Note, the Circle CI and Travis CI jobs only build and test `drake_cmake_installed`
since it is the exemplary case for a lightweight, open-source build on a public
CI server.
